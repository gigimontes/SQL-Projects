# Project #1: Covid19CodeScript 
  In this project I used SQL to analyze data regarding Covid19. Some of the thing I looked into was the percentage of fatality in the United States, Percentage of the population that was infected, total death count per continent, and more. Before every code there will be a brief explanation about what the code is seeking for and what the expected result is. Clock this link to  view the project:
