# Project #1: Covid19 
In this project, I analyze data regarding COVID-19 using SQL. I look into the percentage of fatality in the United States, Percentage of the infected population, total death count per continent, and more. Before every code, there is a brief explanation about what the code is searching for and the expected results. Click this link to view project: Covid19-SQL-Codescript
