# Project #1: Covid19 
  In this project I used SQL to analyze data regarding Covid19. Some of the thing I looked into was the percentage of fatality in the United States, Percentage of the population that was infected, total death count per continent, and more. Before every code there is  a brief explanation about what the code is seeking for and what the expected result is.
