# Project #1: Covid19 

## Overview
In this project, I analyzed data regarding COVID-19 using SQL. I look into the percentage of fatality in the United States, Percentage of the infected population, total death count per continent, and more. Before every query, there is a brief explanation about what the query is searching for and the expected results.
